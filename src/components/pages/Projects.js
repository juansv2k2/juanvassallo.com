My own versificator then, will be used as a platform for composing music that aims to bring new ways of configuring the formal and conceptual architecture of the work, as well as the relationships between form and material."

The core of the artistic proposal is the use of digital technology for the creation (synthesis) and real-time processing of sound, coupled with instrumental improvisation and chance. As a result of this interaction, unpredictable and unrepeatable musical and sound spaces are constructed in each session."
